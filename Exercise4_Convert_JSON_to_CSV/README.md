## Problem Statement

Problem Statement is available here at  [Daniel Beach's Github repo](https://github.com/danielbeach/data-engineering-practice/tree/main/Exercises/Exercise-4)

## Key Tasks 

1. Crawl the `data` directory and identify all the `json` files.
2. Load all the `json` files.
3. Flatten out the `json` data structure.
4. Write the results to a `csv` file, one for one with the `json` file, including the header names.


All tasks were accomplished with 6 lines of code (humble brag).
