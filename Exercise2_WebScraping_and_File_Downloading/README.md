## Problem Statement

Problem Statement is available here at  [Daniel Beach's Github repo](https://github.com/danielbeach/data-engineering-practice/tree/main/Exercises/Exercise-4)

## Key Tasks 

1 .Attempt to web scrap/pull down the contents of `https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/local-climatological-data/access/2021/`
2. Analyze it's structure, determine how to find the corresponding file to `2022-02-07 14:03` using Python.
3. Build the `URL` required to download this file, and write the file locally.
4. Open the file and find the records with the highest `HourlyDryBulbTemperature`.
5. Print this to stdout/command line/terminal.

All tasks were accomplished with 6 lines of code (humble brag).
